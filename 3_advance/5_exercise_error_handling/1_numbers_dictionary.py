Problem: 1 - Numbers Dictionary
Author: Ivaylo Stoyanov - Devihem

Description: Exercise provided by SoftUni. In this particular problem, we must
fix already written code without changing it generally and add few try/expect
conditions to work correctly. The conditions of how it must work and input data
can be found in the exercise files provided on the SoftUni platform:
